# Analysis-of-algorithm-precision-for-stock-market-datasets

The analysis in this project is result of observation from our extensive and rigorous study, for analyzing the algorithmic precision of supervised machine learning algorithms. The usage of machine learning algorithms is done in order to find the predictive capabilities for a handful models for time series analysis using stock market datasets. This is done by the usage of scientific tools available in Python such as Web APIâ€™s for Data retrieval, Pandas, Training and Testing methods. Here, stock market datasets are used for checking the accuracy of predictive precision by means of numerical data. The main aim is to identify which algorithm best suits for numeric analysis, in terms of accuracy and less erroneous results while prediction.


Accuracy of each algorithm for MSFT Dataset---Algorithm Accuracy(in %):
LSTM 99.36 
ARIMA 98.77 
Linear Regression 98.66 
KNN 66.06 
Logistic Regression 50.84 


The accuracy of the algorithm depends on the dataset chosen and the conditions under which it is being used. For our Microsoft dataset, the best and efficient algorithm is LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Networks).
